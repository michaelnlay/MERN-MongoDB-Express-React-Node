/*
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is something that has revolutionized the way that programming is done today. If used correctly, it can save you loads of time. It will also help you to avoid repeating code to solve the same simple problem and make maintaining your code easy and effective. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use and implement OOP.

Understanding object-oriented programming principles is the key to making your code more organized and modular. This chapter is designed to teach object-oriented programming principles to help you better understand how to organize your code in the future.

As you know JavaScript uses a functional programming style. This means that Classes aren't a core part of the JavaScript language and JavaScript isn't inherently Object Oriented. But this doesn't mean that we don't use an OOP style of programming in all of our work. We pair JavaScript Objects and Functions to create Constructors that can mimic an Object Oriented Programming style. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand the fundamental concepts of OOP so that the purpose of these constructors is clearer.

Object oriented programming is used so that we can create models to represent what we have in the real world. For example, in the real world we have visitors to our website, whom we lovingly call 'users'. A user is a real flesh and blood living person, but in our program, we'll use an object to represent the user. Within the object, we may store any data we need to know about the user.
